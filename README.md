# Illumination-Rigid-Needle-Path  

## Overview  
This project addresses the challenges of rigid needle biopsy.

## Features  
- **Optical Illumination Integration**: Innovative methods to guide needle insertion paths.  
- **Path Planning Optimization**: Improved trajectory planning for rigid needle operations.  
- **Biopsy Application**: Designed specifically to address challenges in needle biopsy procedures.  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/illumination-rigid-needle-path.git
   cd illumination-rigid-needle-path
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Prepare input data for the path planning algorithm.  
2. Run the main script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  
3. Visualize results using the built-in plotting tools or integrate them with your application.
